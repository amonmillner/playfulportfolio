# Totem

This project takes headshots of the Olin College Software Design Course's teaching team and uses them in a game to make a virtual totem pole. The faces bounce from side to side until a player presses spacebar to place the face. If a face is supported by the previously placed underneath it, the stack will continue and a new (random) face from the teaching team will appear. If the face has no support at the time the player presses spacebar, the game restarts. Stack faces to the top of the screen to win.

Inspiration: I grew up admiring a certain type of totem poles I would see around Oregon that were exquisitely carved wooden poles featuring faces of people that were part of a particular community's folklore. (For example, the Oregon Zoo presented colorful totem poles honoring the Native American communities of the region). I made this example to be a playful project that could serve as an example for current students learning how to do code reviews. Some of the awkwardness of the code might be intentional :)
